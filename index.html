            <p>To help out flood affected families, Noor started distributing relief packages which includes basic
                supplies like rice, puffed rice, molasses, saline water, potatoes, lentils, candles and matchlights. For
                only $10, you can provide a family with much-needed food and essential items during these difficult
                times. These families are in urgent need of your support, so please consider donating to our flood
                drive.</p>
